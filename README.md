# RSM

RSM (Ragnarok Skill Macro) is an easy-to-use macro tool for chaining skills, items and commands in Ragnarok Online. If the server allows 4rTools, then you can safely use this software.

Examples:

```
{9}{F3 c}{delete}
```
> Press 9 > Press F3 then click > Press Delete key

Note: Global delay (can be set by user) is applied between actions

```
{9}50{y c}{u c}150{u c}
```
> Press 9 > Wait 50ms > Press y then click > (Global delay) > Press u then click > Wait 150ms > Press u then click

Note: Delays can be overridden by specifying the delay between actions
